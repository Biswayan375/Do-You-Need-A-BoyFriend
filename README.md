4. Drawing hurdles between majnu and laila. After drawing source and destination, by dragging the mouse, blocked paths can be drawn on the grid -

5. Hit space bar and majnu's love will march towards laila. All the avaiable paths from source to destination is travarsed according to the BFS
algorithm until it reaches destination -
